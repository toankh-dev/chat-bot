## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is an Orchestrator Agent?

The Orchestrator is the "brain" of the system. It:
1. **Analyzes** user questions to understand intent
2. **Plans** execution strategy (which agents to call, in what order)
3. **Executes** by invoking specialized agents
4. **Synthesizes** results into a coherent response

Think of it like a project manager who delegates tasks to specialists!

### What are Specialized Agents?

Each specialized agent has a specific skill:

- **Report Agent** 📝: Creates Backlog tickets, posts to Slack
- **Summarize Agent** 📊: Analyzes Slack conversations, extracts insights
- **Code Review Agent** 🔍: Reviews GitLab code, checks standards

### How do they work together?

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Summarize today's bugs from Slack and create tickets for them"

Orchestrator thinks:
  "I need to:
   1. Use Summarize Agent to get bugs from Slack
   2. Use Report Agent to create tickets
   3. Synthesize the results"

Orchestrator executes:
  Step 1: Calls Summarize Agent
    → Result: Found 3 bugs
  
  Step 2: Calls Report Agent (3 times)
    → Created: PROJ-123, PROJ-124, PROJ-125
  
  Step 3: Formats response
    → "I found 3 bugs and created tickets: ..."

User receives complete answer!
```

## 📊 Comparison: Single Agent vs Multi-Agent

| Feature | Single Agent | Multi-Agent (This System) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Modularity** | Low | High ✅ |
| **Extensibility** | Hard to extend | Easy to add agents ✅ |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Advanced (per-agent) ✅ |
| **Performance** | Good | Better (parallel execution) ✅ |
| **Cost** | Lower | ~15-20% higher |
| **Maintenance** | Harder (monolithic) | Easier (modular) ✅ |
| **Testing** | Hard | Easy (test each agent) ✅ |

**Verdict:** Multi-agent is worth the extra 15-20% cost for production systems!

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Development Environment
```
Monthly cost: ~$350-500

Breakdown:
- Bedrock Agents (4): ~$100-150
- Lambda: ~$10-20
- OpenSearch Serverless (1 OCU): ~$173
- Knowledge Base: ~$30-50
- DynamoDB: ~$10-20
- Other: ~$27-90
```

### Production Environment
```
Monthly cost: ~$700-1,400

Breakdown:
- Bedrock Agents (4): ~$200-400
- Lambda: ~$20-50
- OpenSearch Serverless (2-4 OCU): ~$350-700
- Knowledge Base: ~$50-100
- DynamoDB: ~$50-100
- ElastiCache: ~$25-50
- Other: ~$55-100
```

**Cost Optimization Tips:**
1. Enable response caching (saves 40-60% on Bedrock calls)
2. Use Lambda reserved concurrency
3. Optimize Knowledge Base queries with filters
4. Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
5. Monitor and set budget alarms

✅ **Cognito Authentication** - User management and JWT tokens  
✅ **IAM Least Privilege** - Each component has minimal permissions  
✅ **Secrets Manager** - No hardcoded credentials  
✅ **Encryption** - At rest and in transit  
✅ **VPC** - Network isolation for Lambda and OpenSearch  
✅ **CloudTrail** - Full audit logging

## 📈 Performance Metrics

**Target SLAs:**
- Response time: < 3s (p95)
- Agent execution: < 5s (p95)
- Knowledge Base query: < 1s (p95)
- API availability: 99.9%
- Error rate: < 1%

**Scalability:**

- Knowledge Base: 100K+ documents
- Vector dimensions: 1024

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each Lambda function tested independently
- Agent configurations validated
- API schemas verified

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Multi-agent coordination validation
- Error handling verification

### Load Tests
- Concurrent user simulation
- Peak load testing
- Failover testing

### Example Test Scenarios
1. Simple query: "What are open bugs?"
2. Single agent: "Create a ticket"
3. Multi-agent: "Summarize Slack and create tickets"
4. Complex workflow: "Generate weekly status report"
